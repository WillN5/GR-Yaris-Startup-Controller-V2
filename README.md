This device will automatically press any (or all) of the annoying buttons in a GR Yaris when you first start your car:
* Lane Departure Alert (turn off)
* iMT (turn on)
* Auto Stop/Start (turn off)
* Select Sport/Track mode
* Turn ESC to expert mode, or switch ESC fully off

The controller simply presses the buttons (electronically) upon first start up. Original button functionality remains unaffected.

This project is a development of that idea to include the additional button presses, wrapped up in a neat package.
